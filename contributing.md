## PR Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add triathlon-resource-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the resource is awesome.
* Add the link: `* [triathlon-resource-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own triathlon content. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
